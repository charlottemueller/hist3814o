This was my first attempt at gephi analysis 
Once gephi was downloaed I uploaed my cleaned texas correpondance file
I had trouble uploading at first as a I got an error message saying that one of my rows was empty
After re-opening my csv file I found the error on line 61 where there was a blank space in column 2 row 61
I deleted this row and was able to upload to gephi
It was interesting to see the letters visualized and then be able to "cut" smaller disconnected components 
A new, more compact and organized shape emerges 
The coloured and sized graphic now shows one network associated with the last president and the bottom network with the second president
it was interesting to see how this visualization could be used to see connections between the frequency and prevalence of correspondance in different periods of the republic of texas
I wonder what the significance is of an increase in correspondance from the first president to the second?
I assume the increase in correspondance of the last president comes from the panic of the potential dissolution of the republic
