I had some trouble downloading openrefine as I couldn't "unzip" it but I eventually was able to export it to my digital history file
I created a new project using my cleancorrespondance file in my digital history folder and renamed it "module3exercise2"
I followed the instructions and merged and clustered cells but I only managed to get down to 157 options in "sender" and 169 in "recipent"
I noticed that there were many errors (such as numbers in names) but I could not guess what the accurate name was so I left it and did my best with educated guesses
Once I finished I hit custom tabular exporter and unselected date and downloaded my newly cleaned csv file!
