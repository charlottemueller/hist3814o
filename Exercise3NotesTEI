when downloading zip of teihist3907 I had to go to the parent directory and download this entire folder to access the subfolder needed
I don't have much experience with zips (i know they need to be unzipped) but when I double clicked the downloaded file it showed up in my files
went to the recovered histories site, it seems to have primary documents but no sources or affiliation with academic institutions 
This makes me question whether it could be a trustworthy provider of sources, but the source we are examining seems authentic
I managed to set up my workspace on sublime after some difficulty opening blanktemplate.txt
I decided to use page 9 to transcribe 
There was one name (Mr. Hall) and three locations in my transcription,as well as one argument on human nature and adaptability.
